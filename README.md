This script is using the yfinance library to download historical stock data for a specific ticker symbol entered by the user. It then uses the TA-Lib library to calculate various Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicators (Tenkan-sen, Kijun-sen, Senkou Span A, Senkou Span B, Chikou Span) from the historical data. Then, it uses the Scikit-learn library's HistGradientBoostingRegressor to train a model using these indicators as features and the closing price as the target. Finally, it uses the trained model to make predictions for the next 30 days, adds random noise to the predictions, and plots the historical data and predictions.
